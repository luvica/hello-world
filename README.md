GUIDES/JOINTS AFTER OBJECT CUT TO HELP GETTING PARTS TOGETHER AFTER PRINT (with glue or not)
1) this is the first request I open in github, I have no experience programming. Sorry for the inconveniences, any help is welcome. I was redirected by Prusa helpdesk to talk here.
2) Problem: one of the most important features of 3D printing is scaling. Unfortunately our base has a limited size. For sure you had to cut objects in two or more parts to print them. Thats not a problem until you have to join them, superglue in one hand, baking powder in the other hand, eye adjusting top and bottom at the same time...
3) Idea: when you cut an object, an option should be available, which allows creating guides/joints/inserts to be placed so, after printing, it would be easy joining all parts together. 
4) Options: A) simple cylinder-hole (or alternative shape) as guidance B) if cut area is too small, the guidance could be added at a side of the cut (i.e. if you cut a helmet, you could add guidance internally, so it is not visible but useful). C) Not only guidance but a joint which doesnt require glue, due to mechanical fixation. (i.e. think in kids toys, how they fix arms to body). 
5) Question: Do you find it interesting? Please contact me if your answer is a yes.
